## üß† AI Integration

The application uses OpenAI's GPT models for two primary functions:

1. **Portfolio Analysis**: Evaluates your portfolio composition, balance, risk, and diversification.
2. **Investment Recommendations**: Provides specific actions for each asset and suggests new investments.

The AI integration uses a sophisticated prompt management system found in `portfolio/prompts.py`, which allows for:
- Structured prompt templates
- Dynamic data injection
- Configurable model parameters
- Easy extension for new AI features

### üîÑ Conversation Persistence and Context

The application supports persistent conversations with the AI for both analysis and recommendations:

- Each conversation is assigned a unique `conversation_id`
- Clients can pass the `conversation_id` in subsequent requests to continue the conversation
- The AI maintains context from previous interactions within the same conversation
- Separate conversation threads for analysis and recommendations
- Leverages OpenAI's thread-based conversation APIs (with fallback to direct completions)
- Dedicated `chat` parameter allows users to provide conversational context or specific questions
- Both analysis and recommendations endpoints support the `chat` parameter for consistent user experience

## üîí Security and Debugging

- API keys are stored in environment variables
- The `.env` file is excluded from version control
- Django's security features protect against common web vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive AI debug mode captures full prompt messages (system + user) for all LLM calls
- Debug information includes timing, token usage, and complete conversation context

## üìö AI Prompt System

The application features a modular prompt management system that:
1. Maintains consistent AI interactions
2. Formats data for optimal AI understanding
3. Parses AI responses into structured data
4. Handles errors gracefully
5. Incorporates conversational context from user chat input

This system makes it easy to add new AI-powered features by simply defining new prompt templates.
