## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yevgetman/django-finance.git
   cd django-finance
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
   ```
   # OpenAI API Configuration
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o
   OPENAI_RECOMMENDATIONS_MODEL=gpt-4o
   
   # OpenAI Assistants (optional)

   ```

2. Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

### Running the Application

1. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## üì° API Endpoints

**Authentication Required:** All API endpoints require authentication using an API key in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: ApiKey YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

### User Registration

```
POST /api/register/
```
**No authentication required** - Creates a new user account and returns an API key for subsequent requests.

**Required Parameters:**
- `email`: User's email address (used as username)

**Optional Parameters:**
- `first_name`: User's first name
- `last_name`: User's last name

Example request:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe"
}
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "user_id": "84b27392-2345-4b5b-87ba-d370d005b2b4",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",

  "created_at": "2025-06-05T18:27:39.123456Z",
  "message": "User created successfully"
}
```

**Important:** Store the API key securely as it cannot be retrieved again. Use it in the Authorization header for all subsequent API requests.

### Stock Information

```
POST /api/ticker-info/
```
Returns sector, market-cap, and classification details for the specified tickers. Send a JSON body such as:

```json

## üë• User Management

The application includes management commands for creating and managing API users:

### Create a New User
```bash
python manage.py create_api_user username email@example.com --first-name John --last-name Doe
```

### List All Users
```bash
python manage.py list_api_users
```

### List Only Active Users
```bash
python manage.py list_api_users --active-only
```

### Show Partial API Keys (for debugging)
```bash
python manage.py list_api_users --show-keys
```

### Regenerate API Key for a User
```bash
python manage.py regenerate_api_key username
```

**Important:** API keys are displayed only once when created or regenerated. Store them securely as they cannot be retrieved again.

## üß† AI Integration

The application uses OpenAI's GPT models for two primary functions:

1. **Portfolio Analysis**: Evaluates your portfolio composition, balance, risk, and diversification.
2. **Investment Recommendations**: Provides specific actions for each asset and suggests new investments.

The AI integration uses a sophisticated prompt management system found in `portfolio/prompts.py`, which allows for:
- Structured prompt templates
- Dynamic data injection
- Configurable model parameters
- Easy extension for new AI features

### üîÑ Conversation Persistence and Context

The application supports persistent conversations with the AI for both analysis and recommendations:

- Each conversation is assigned a unique `conversation_id`
- Clients can pass the `conversation_id` in subsequent requests to continue the conversation
- The AI maintains context from previous interactions within the same conversation
- Separate conversation threads for analysis and recommendations
- Leverages OpenAI's thread-based conversation APIs (with fallback to direct completions)
- Dedicated `chat` parameter allows users to provide conversational context or specific questions
- Both analysis and recommendations endpoints support the `chat` parameter for consistent user experience

## üîí Security and Debugging

- API keys are stored in environment variables
- The `.env` file is excluded from version control
- Django's security features protect against common web vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive AI debug mode captures full prompt messages (system + user) for all LLM calls
- Debug information includes timing, token usage, and complete conversation context

## üìö AI Prompt System

The application features a modular prompt management system that:
1. Maintains consistent AI interactions
2. Formats data for optimal AI understanding
3. Parses AI responses into structured data
4. Handles errors gracefully
5. Incorporates conversational context from user chat input

This system makes it easy to add new AI-powered features by simply defining new prompt templates.
