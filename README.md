### Running the Application

1. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## üì° API Endpoints

**Authentication System:**

All API endpoints require the **Authorization header** with a global API key:
```
Authorization: ApiKey GLOBAL_API_KEY_HERE
```

For personalized features and user-specific data, include the optional **Authentication header**:
```
Authentication: ApiKey USER_API_KEY_HERE
```

**Access Levels:**
- **Anonymous access**: Only Authorization header required (global API key)
- **Authenticated access**: Both Authorization and Authentication headers required

### User Registration

```
POST /api/register/
```
**No authentication required** - Creates a new user account and returns an API key for subsequent requests.

**Required Parameters:**
- `email`: User's email address (used as username)

**Optional Parameters:**
- `first_name`: User's first name
- `last_name`: User's last name

Example request:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe"
}
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "api_key": "YQ52FZMskRJBRiHlt5Rh3W7arwFkcgrqf5rGlL3pQ4rqXviF4sxoBx_ER4GKFo-h",
  "message": "User created successfully"
}
```

**Important:** Store the API key securely as it cannot be retrieved again. Use it in the Authorization header for all subsequent API requests.

### Stock Information

```
POST /api/ticker-info/
```
Returns sector, market-cap, and classification details for the specified tickers. Send a JSON body such as:

```json
{"tickers": ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL"]}
```

### Portfolio Analysis

```
POST /api/analyze/
```
Analyzes a portfolio and provides AI-powered insights (without recommendations).

**Parameters:**

}
```

### Chat Continuation

```
POST /api/chat/
```
Dedicated endpoint for follow-up conversations and questions related to previous analysis or recommendations. Supports both authenticated and anonymous users.

**Parameters:**
- `message`: The chat message or question (required)
- `conversation_id`: UUID of the conversation to continue (optional)

**Authentication Options:**
- **Anonymous users**: Only Authorization header required (conversations not linked to user accounts)
- **Authenticated users**: Both Authorization and Authentication headers required (conversations linked to user accounts)

Example request:
```json
{
  "message": "What if I want to be more aggressive with my investments?",
  "conversation_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
}
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "response": "For a more aggressive approach, you could increase your allocation to growth stocks and emerging sectors like AI and clean tech. Consider reducing your bond allocation and increasing exposure to small-cap growth funds...",
  "conversation_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
}
```

## üë• User Management

The application includes management commands for creating and managing API users:

### Create a New User
```bash
python manage.py create_api_user username email@example.com --first-name John --last-name Doe
```

### List All Users
```bash
python manage.py list_api_users
```

### List Only Active Users
```bash
python manage.py list_api_users --active-only
```

### Show Partial API Keys (for debugging)
```bash
python manage.py list_api_users --show-keys
```

### Regenerate API Key for a User
```bash
python manage.py regenerate_api_key username
```

**Important:** API keys are displayed only once when created or regenerated. Store them securely as they cannot be retrieved again.

## üß† AI Integration

The application uses OpenAI's GPT models for two primary functions:

1. **Portfolio Analysis**: Evaluates your portfolio composition, balance, risk, and diversification.
2. **Investment Recommendations**: Provides specific actions for each asset and suggests new investments.

The AI integration uses a sophisticated prompt management system found in `portfolio/prompts.py`, which allows for:
- Structured prompt templates
- Dynamic data injection
- Configurable model parameters
- Easy extension for new AI features

### üîÑ Conversation Persistence and Context

The application supports persistent conversations with the AI for both analysis and recommendations:

- Each conversation is assigned a unique `conversation_id`
- Clients can pass the `conversation_id` in subsequent requests to continue the conversation
- The AI maintains context from previous interactions within the same conversation
- Separate conversation threads for analysis and recommendations
- Leverages OpenAI's thread-based conversation APIs (with fallback to direct completions)
- Dedicated `chat` parameter allows users to provide conversational context or specific questions
- Both analysis and recommendations endpoints support the `chat` parameter for consistent user experience

## üîí Security and Authentication

### Authentication Flow
- **Authorization header** (required): Contains global API key that grants access to the API itself
- **Authentication header** (optional): Contains user-specific API key that links requests to user accounts
- **Anonymous users**: Can access API with only the Authorization header
- **Authenticated users**: Can access personalized features with both headers
- **Error responses**:
  - Missing Authorization header: 403 Forbidden
  - Invalid Authentication header: 401 Unauthorized

## üîç Debugging

- API keys are stored in environment variables
- The `.env` file is excluded from version control
- Django's security features protect against common web vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive AI debug mode captures full prompt messages (system + user) for all LLM calls
- Debug information includes timing, token usage, complete conversation context, and AI provider details
- AI provider tracking shows which provider (OpenAI or Anthropic) was used for each request
- Conditional debug logging based on `DEBUG` environment variable to keep production logs clean

### AI Debug Mode

When `AI_DEBUG=True` is set in your `.env` file, all API responses will include detailed debug information:

```json
{
  "ai_debug": {
    "enabled": true,
    "total_request_duration_ms": 7581,
    "llm_calls": [
      {
        "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
        "provider": "Anthropic",
        "prompt_type": "portfolio_recommendations",
        "timestamp": "2025-06-08T13:45:30.123456",
        "config": {
          "max_tokens": 1000,
          "temperature": 0.7
        },
        "response": {
          "content_length": 2500,
          "duration_ms": 3200
        }
      }
    ],
    "summary": {
      "total_llm_calls": 1,
      "models_used": ["claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"],
      "providers_used": ["Anthropic"],
      "prompt_types": ["portfolio_recommendations"],
      "total_llm_duration_ms": 3200,
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

This debug information is invaluable for:
- Tracking which AI provider was used for each request
- Monitoring performance differences between providers
- Debugging issues with specific models or providers
- Analyzing prompt effectiveness and response quality
- Optimizing token usage and request duration

## üìö AI Prompt System

The application features a modular prompt management system that:
1. Maintains consistent AI interactions
2. Formats data for optimal AI understanding
3. Parses AI responses into structured data
4. Handles errors gracefully
5. Incorporates conversational context from user chat input

This system makes it easy to add new AI-powered features by simply defining new prompt templates.
